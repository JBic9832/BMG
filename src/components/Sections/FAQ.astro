        <Question
            question=`What exactly does a “smart home installer” do?`
            answer=`We professionally set up and connect devices like smart lights, thermostats, cameras, voice assistants, and more — then walk you through how to use them. We handle the technical side so everything just works.`
        />
        <Question
            question=`How do I know what I need?`
            answer=`Every project starts with a short consultation — either by phone or in person. We’ll discuss your goals, assess your Wi-Fi and devices, and recommend the best options for your home so everything fits your needs and budget.`
        />
        <Question
            question=`Do I need new equipment, or can you install what I already own?`
            answer=`Both! We can install new devices you’ve purchased or configure the equipment you already have. During your consultation, we’ll make sure everything is compatible and will work together smoothly.`
        />
        <Question
            question=`Is my Wi-Fi strong enough for smart home devices?`
			answer=`Most homes can handle it with no problems or just a few small adjustments. We test your network during setup and can improve your Wi-Fi coverage so every device stays connected reliably.`
        />
        <Question
            question=`Do I need a special license or electrician to install smart devices?`
            answer=`Not for the services we provide. We handle low-voltage and consumer smart tech installations that don’t require electrical rewiring — no electrician or permit needed.`
        />
        <Question
            question=`Can you help me with security systems and smart locks?`
            answer=`Yes. We install smart cameras, doorbells, and locks that you control from your phone. We don’t duplicate keys or rekey mechanical locks — everything we do is focused on electronic smart home security.`
        />
        <Question
            question=`How long does a typical installation take?`
            answer=`Most visits take 1–3 hours, depending on how many devices you’re setting up. Larger systems (like full lighting or camera networks) may take a half-day or more. We always give you an estimate before starting.`
        />
        <Question
            question=`What areas do you serve?`

        <Question
            question=`What if I’m not tech-savvy?`
            answer=`Not to worry — that’s who we’re here for. We take our time explaining how everything works and make sure you feel comfortable using your new setup before we leave.`
        />
        <Question
            question=`Is my information private when you set up cameras or smart devices?`
            answer=`Yes. We treat your privacy seriously. We only access your devices long enough to connect and test them, and you’ll always have full control of your accounts and passwords.`
